2.1.2
Algorithm: Selection sort

A. What is the maximum number of exchanges involving any particular item during selection sort?
Selection sort uses maximum n - 1 exchanges because on last item we do not need to invoke exchange
So particular item can be exchanged maximum n - 1 times.

Example can be any list with at least 2 items where:
 - 1st item is biggest
 - rest of the array is sorted

Example:
G A B C D E F
A G B C D E F
A B G C D E F
A B C G D E F
A B C D G E F
A B C D E G F
A B C D E F G


B. What is the average number of exchanges involving an item?
Assume we have:
 - N items
 - N-1 exchanges (every exchange swaps 2 items) = 2*(N-1)

So average number of exchanges an item is:
  2*(N-1) / N
  Approx. 2 exchanges (in fact a bit less than 2 for big finite lists)
