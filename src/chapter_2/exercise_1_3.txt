2.1.3
Algorithm: Selection sort

Give me an example of an array of N items that maximizes the number of times the
test a[j] < a[min] succeeds (and therefore min gets updated) during the operation
of selection sort.

5 4 3 2 1

Example:
5 4 3 2 1 - n-1 = 4 test passed
1 4 3 2 5 - n-3 = 2 test passed
1 2 3 4 5 - n-5 = 0 test passed
